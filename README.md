# Ontology Study Project

Welcome to the **Ontology Study Project**! This repository is dedicated to exploring, learning, and creating ontologies using semantic web technologies. Our goal is to build a collaborative environment for anyone interested in studying ontologies, regardless of their level of expertise.

## üöÄ Objectives

- Provide a collection of resources for understanding ontologies.
- Facilitate hands-on projects to practice ontology creation.
- Foster a collaborative community for learning and sharing knowledge.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- **`/ontologies/`**: Contains example ontology files in various formats (e.g., OWL, RDF).
- **`/resources/`**: Links and documents to help you get started with ontology design.
- **`/examples/`**: Sample projects demonstrating the use of ontologies in different domains.
- **`/scripts/`**: Scripts for ontology validation, conversion, or analysis.

## üõ† Technologies

This project primarily focuses on the following technologies:

- **OWL (Web Ontology Language)**
- **RDF (Resource Description Framework)**
- **SPARQL (Query Language for RDF)**
- **Prot√©g√©** for ontology editing
